# Lost
A boy runs away and gets lost in the woods... but it's deeper than that...

## Summary
James Picard is born and raised on a farm in Roscia somewhat near the castle. When his father doesn't return from war, he runs away into the heart of the woods, where he loses his sense of direction. He meets a mysterious old man that leads him to a hut. This old man is his only chance of getting home alive... besides the fact that the old man has been banned from Roscia for over 50 years and rarely leaves his hut.

## Locations
* #### Abandoned Cave

  The Abandoned Cave is a cave found in Vulture Peaks. When James is stuck in the storm, he stays in the Abandoned Cave. Basic supplies are in here.

* #### Bandit Camp

  The Bandit Camp is located in the Dark Forest. The Bandits like to rob James of his materials. James can retrieve his supplies if he is careful enough.

* #### Castle

  The Castle is located in the heart of Roscia, the main city in Lost. The Castle is only accessible at the end

* #### Dark Forest

  While exploring the Dark Forest, James may run into one of the members of the bandit posse. Until James has weapons that are strong enough, he will continually lose supplies when running into them. Alistair can be seen in the trees, Axwell can be seen in the bushes, and Arcane can be seen by the river.

* #### House

  The house is only accessible in the beginning and the end of Lost. James runs away from his house when word gets around that his father died.

* #### Old Hut

  The Old Hut is where the Old Man lives. The Old Man helps out James by creating potions, weapons, and tools for him. The Old Man escorts James back home where he can be safe again. James is looked down on, however, and his mother and neighbor build a home in the Red Grasslands for peace.

* #### Vulture Peaks

  Vulture Peaks is where all of the dragons live. James needs to collect objects from the dragonâ€™s caves so the Old Man can craft better weapons for James. Many rare items are here, although it is a dangerous region.
